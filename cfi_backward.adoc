== Backward-edge control-flow integrity

A shadow stack is a second stack used to push the link register if it needs to
be spilled to make a new procedure call. Leaf functions do not need to spill the
link register.

The shadow stack, similar to the regular stack, grows downwards, i.e. from higher
addresses to lower addresses. Each entry on the shadow stack is `XLEN` wide and
holds the link register value. The `ssp` points to the top of the shadow stack,
i.e. address of the last element pushed on the shadow stack.

[NOTE]
====
Compilers when generating code for a CFI enabled program must protect the link
register, e.g. `x1` and/or `x5`, from arbitrary modification by not emitting
unsafe code sequences.
====

=== Backward-edge CFI instruction encoding

The backward-edge CFI extension introduces the following instructions for shadow
stack operations. All instructions are encoded using the SYSTEM major opcode and
using the `mop.r` and `mop.rr` instructions defined by the Zimop extension.

[width=100%]

Encoding `rd` as `x0` is not supported for `ssamoswap`.

When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 0, then Zisslpcfi is not enabled for privilege modes less
than M and backward-edge CFI is not enabled at privilege levels less than M.

When `V=0` and `menvcfg.CFIE` is 1, then backward-edge CFI is enabled at S-mode.
When `V=0` and `menvcfg.CFIE` is 1, then backward-edge CFI is enabled at U-mode if
`mstatus.UBCFIE` is 1.

When `henvcfg.CFIE` is 0, then Zisslpcfi is not enabled for use when `V=1`.

When `V=1` and `menvcfg.CFIE` and `henvcfg.CFIE` are both 1, then backward-edge
CFI is enabled in VS-mode. When `V=1` and `menvcfg.CFIE` and `henvcfg.CFIE` are
both 1, then backward-edge CFI is enabled in VU-mode if `vsstatus.UBCFIE` is 1.

The term `xBCFIE` is used to determine if backward-edge CFI is enabled at a
privilege level `x` and is defined as follows:

.`xBCFIE` determination
[source, text]
----
if ( privilege == M-mode ) 
    xBCFIE = 1
else if ( menvcfg.CFIE == 1 && V == 0 && privilege == S-mode )
    xBCFIE = 1
else if ( menvcfg.CFIE == 1 && V == 0 && privilege == U-mode )
    xBCFIE = mstatus.UBCFIE
else if ( menvcfg.CFIE == 1 && henvcfg.CFIE == 1 && V == 1 && privilege == S-mode )
    xBCFIE = 1
else if ( menvcfg.CFIE == 1 && henvcfg.CFIE == 1 && V == 1 && privilege == U-mode )
    xBCFIE = vsstatus.UBCFIE
else
    xBCFIE = 0
----

When backward-edge CFI is not enabled(`xBCFIE = 0`):

* The instructions defined for backward-edge CFI revert to their Zimop defined
  behavior and write 0 to [rd].

[NOTE]
====
The use of shadow stacks at U-mode must be explicitly enabled per application.
Explicit enable for user mode applications allows such an application to invoke
shared libraries that may have shadow stack instructions even when the
application itself has backward-edge CFI not enable. The shadow stack
instructions invoked in the context of this application revert to their Zimop
defined behavior.

When Zisslpcfi is enabled, the use of backward-edge CFI is always enabled for
use at S-mode. However, it is benign to use an operating system that has not
been compiled with shadow stack instructions. Such an operating system that does
not use backward-edge CFI for S-mode execution may still enable the
backward-edge CFI use by U-mode.

When Zisslpcfi is implemented, the use of backward-edge CFI is always enabled
at M-mode. However, it is benign to use M-mode firmware that has not been
compiled with shadow stack instructions.
====

[NOTE]
====
When programs using shadow stack instructions are installed on a machine that
supports the CFI extensions but the operating system installed does not enable
the CFI extensions, the program continues to function due to Zimop defined
behavior of writing 0 to [rd] and not causing an illegal-instruction exception.

When programs using shadow stack instructions are installed on a machine that
does not support the CFI extensions but support the Zimop extension, the
program continues to function due to Zimop defined behavior of writing 0 to
[rd] and not causing an illegal-instruction exception.

On machines that do not support Zimop extension, the instructions cause an
illegal-instruction exception. Installing programs that use the shadow stack
instructions on such machines is not supported.
====

=== Push to and Pop from the shadow stack

A push operation is defined as decrement of the `ssp` by `XLEN` followed by a
write of the link register at the new top of the shadow stack. A pop operation
is defined as a `XLEN` wide read from the current top of the shadow stack
followed by an increment of the `ssp`.

To push a link register on the shadow stack, the CFI extension provides
`sspush` instruction. To pop a link register from the shadow stack, the CFI
extension provides `sspop` instruction.

[NOTE]
====
Programs operating in shadow stack mode store the return address to the data
stack as well as the shadow stack in the function prologue. Such programs when
returning from the function load the link register from the data stack and load
a shadow copy of the link register from the shadow stack. The two values are
then compared (using the sschkra instruction that is discussed later). If the
values do not match it is indicative of a shadow stack violation and causes an
illegal-instruction exception. The function prologue and epilog of a function
using shadow stacks is as follows:

    function_entry:
        sspush x1      # push link register x1 on shadow stack
         :
         : 
        sspop x5       # pop from shadow stack into x5
        sschkra x5, x1 # compare link register x1 to shadow 
                       # link register x5; faults if not same
        ret

When x1 is used by the ABI as the link register, the x5 may be used to load the
shadow link register value from the shadow stack. Alternatively, if the ABI uses
x5 as the link register, then the x1 register may be used as the shadow link
register. 

A leaf function i.e. a function that does not itself make function calls does
not need to push the link register to the shadow stack or pop it from the shadow
stack. The return value may be held in the link register itself for the duration
of the function execution.

In the RVI psABI, the x1 register is designated as the link register and x5
register is designated as a temporary register. Since the shadow link register
is loaded at the tail of the function, prior to return, the x5 register being
used as the shadow link register does not impose a burden on the compiler as the
x5 register, being a temporary register that is not preserved across a call, is
usually free for use at the tail of the function.

Programs operating in the control stack mode may store the return address only
to the shadow stack in the function prologue. Such functions when returning from
the function load the link register value from the shadow stack. Such programs
may either use the x1 or x5 register, depending on their ABI, as the link
register. The hardware return-address prediction stacks detect the use of x1/x5
as the rd and x1/x5 as the source for a JALR instruction to infer if the JALR is
used for a call or a return semantic for the purposes of prediction. To support
both options the CFI extension provides the x1 and x5 variants of the shadow
stack load and store.
====

`sspop` performs a load identically to the existing `LOAD` instruction with the
difference that the base is implicitly `ssp`, the width is implicitly `XLEN`.
`sspush` performs a store identically to the existing `STORE` instruction with
the difference that the base is implicitly `ssp`, the width is implicitly `XLEN`.

The `sspush` and `sspop` require the virtual address in `ssp` to have a shadow stack
attribute (see Shadow Stack Memory Protection). 

If the virtual address in `ssp` is not `XLEN` aligned then the instructions cause a
load or store/AMO address-misaligned exception.

[NOTE]
====
Misaligned accesses to shadow stack are not required and enforcing alignment is
more secure to detect errors in the program.
====

The operation of the `sspush` instructions is as follows:

.`sspush` operation
[source, text]
----
If (xBCFIE = 1)
    [ssp] = [ssp] - (XLEN/8)   # decrement ssp by XLEN/8
   *[ssp] = [src]              # Store src value to address in ssp
else
    [dst] = 0
endif
----

The operation of the `sspop` instructions is as follows:

.`sspop` operation
[source, text]
----
If (xBCFIE = 1)
    dst   = *[ssp]             # Load dst from address in ssp
    [ssp] = [ssp] + (XLEN/8)   # increment ssp by XLEN/8
else
    [dst] = 0;
endif
----

[NOTE]
====
Store to load forwarding is a common technique employed by high performance
processor implementations. CFI implementations may restrict forwarding from a
non-shadow-stack store to a `sspop` instruction. A non-shadow-stack store causes a
fault if done to a page mapped as a shadow stack. However such determination may
be delayed till the PTE has been examined and thus may be used to transiently
forward the data from such stores to a `sspop`.
====

[NOTE]
====
A common operation performed on stacks is to unwind them to support constructs
like setjmp/longjmp, C++ exception handling, etc. A program that uses shadow
stacks must unwind the shadow stack in addition to the stack used to store data.
The unwind function must verify that it does not accidentally unwind past the
bounds of the shadow stack. Shadow stacks are expected to be bounded on each end
using guard pages i.e. pages that do not have a shadow stack attribute. To
detect if the unwind occurs past the bounds of the shadow stack the unwind may
be done in maximal increments of 4 KiB and testing for the ssp to be still
pointing to a shadow stack page or has unwound into the guard page. The
following examples illustrate the use of backward-edge CFI instructions to unwind a
shadow stack.

[literal]
setjmp() {
    :
    :
    // read and save top of stack pointer to jmp_buf
    asm("ssprr %0" : "=r"(cur_ssp):);
    jmp_buf->saved_ssp = cur_ssp;
    :
    :
}
longjmp() {
    :
    // Read current shadow stack pointer and 
    // compute number of call frames to unwind
    asm("ssprr %0" : "=r"(cur_ssp):);
    // Skip the unwind if backward-edge CFI not enabled
    asm("beqz %0, back_cfi_not_enabled" : "=r"(cur_ssp):);
    num_unwind = jmp_buf->saved_ssp - cur_ssp;
    // Unwind the frames in a loop
    while ( num_unwind > 0 ) {
        step = ( num_unwind >= 4096 ) ? 4096 : num_unwind;
        cur_ssp += step;
        num_unwind -= step;
        // write the ssp register with unwound value
        asm("csrw %0, $ssp_csr_num" : "=r"(cur_ssp):);
        // Test if unwound past the shadow stack bounds
        asm("sspush x5");
        asm("sspop  x5");
    }
back_cfi_not_enabled:
    :
}
====


=== Read `ssp` into a register

The `ssprr` instruction is provided to move the contents of `ssp` to the destination
register. 

The operation of the `ssprr` instructions is as follows:

.`ssprr` operation
[source, text]
----
If (xBCFIE = 1)
    [dst] = [ssp]
else
    [dst] = 0;
endif
----

[NOTE]
====
The property of Zimop writing 0 to the rd when the extension using Zimop is
not present or not enabled may be used by such functions to skip over unwind
actions by dynamically detecting if the backward-edge CFI extension is enabled.

An example sequence such as the following may be used:

[literal]
    ssprr t0                  # mv ssp to t0
    beqz bcfi_not_enabled     # zero is not a valid shadow stack
                              # pointer by convention
    # Shadow stacks enabled
    :
    :
bcfi_not_enabled:
====


=== Verifying return address

Programs operating with a shadow stack push the return address onto the data
stack as well as the shadow stack in the function prologue. Such programs when
returning from the function pop the link register from the data stack and pop a
shadow copy of the link register from the shadow stack. The two values are then
compared. If the values do not match it is indicative of a corruption of the
return address variable and the program causes an illegal instruction exception.

When x1 is used by the ABI as the link register, the x5 may be used to hold the
shadow link register value from the shadow stack. Alternatively, if the ABI uses
x5 as the link register, then the x1 register may be used as the shadow link
register. 

A `sschkra` instruction is provided to perform the comparison.

The operation of the `sschkra` instruction is as follows:

.`sschkra` operation
[source, text]
----
If (xBCFIE = 1)
   if [x1] != [x5]
       Raise illegal-instruction exception
   endif
else
    [dst] = 0;
endif
----

=== Atomic Swap from a shadow stack location

The CFI extension defines an `ssamoswap` instruction to atomically swap the `XLEN`
bits of src register with `XLEN` bits on the shadow stack at address in `addr` and
store the value from address in `src` into register `dst`.

The `ssamoswap` is always sequentially consistent and cannot be reordered with
earlier or later memory operations from the same hart. 

The `ssamoswap` requires the virtual address in `addr` to have a shadow stack
attribute (see Shadow Stack Memory Protection).

If the virtual address is not `XLEN` aligned then the instructions cause a
store/AMO address-misaligned exception.

The operation of the `ssamoswap` instructions is as follows:

.`ssamoswap` operation
[source, text]
----
If (xBCFIE = 1)
    Perform the following atomically with sequential consistency
        [dst]  = *[addr]
       *[addr] = [src]
else
    [dst] = 0;
endif
----

[NOTE]
====
Stack switching is a common operation in user programs as well as supervisor
programs. When a stack switch is performed the stack pointer of the currently
active stack is saved into a context data structure and the new stack is made
active by loading a new stack pointer from a context data structure. 

When shadow stacks are enabled for a program, the program needs to additionally
switch the shadow stack pointer. The pointer to the top of the deactivated
shadow stack if held in a context data structure may be susceptible to memory
corruption vulnerabilities. To protect the pointer value the program may then
store it at the top of the shadow stack itself and thus create a checkpoint. 

An example sequence to store and restore the shadow stack pointer is as follows:

[literal]
# The a0 register holds the pointer to top of new shadow
# to switch to. The current ssp is first pushed on the current
# shadow stack and the ssp is restored from new shadow stack
save_shadow_stack_pointer:
    ssprr  x5                   # read ssp and push value onto
    sspush x5                   # shadow stack. The [ssp] now
    addi   x5, x5, -(XLEN/8)    # holds ptr+XLEN/8. The [x5] now 
                                # holds ptr. Save away x5
                                # into a context structure to
                                # restore later.
restore_shadow_stack_pointer:
    ssamoswap t0, x0, (a0)      # t0=*[a0] and *[a0]=0
                                # The [a0] should hold ptr'
                                # The [t0] should hold ptr'+XLEN/8
    addi      a0, a0, (XLEN/8)  # a0+XLEN/8 must match to t0
    bne       t0, a0, crash     # if not crash program
    csrw      ssp, t0           # setup new ssp

Further the program may enforce an invariant that a shadow stack can be active
only on one hart by using the `ssamoswap` when performing the restore from the
checkpoint such that the checkpointed data is zeroed as part of the restore
sequence and multiple hart attempt to restore the checkpointed data only one of
them succeeds.
====


=== Shadow Stack Memory Protection

To protect shadow stack memory the memory is associated with a new page type -
Shadow Stack (SS) page - in the page tables. 

When the Smepmp extension is supported the PMP configuration registers are
enhanced to support a shadow stack memory region for use by M-mode.

==== Virtual-Memory system extension for Shadow Stack

The shadow stack memory is protected using page table attributes such that it
cannot be stored to by instructions other than `sspush` and `ssamoswap`. The
`sspop` instruction can only load from shadow stack memory.

The shadow stack can be read using all instructions that load from memory. 

Attempting to fetch an instruction from a shadow stack page raises a fetch
page-fault exception.

The encoding `R=0`, `W=1`, and `X=0`, is defined to mean a shadow stack page.
When `menvcfg.CFIE=0`, this encoding continues to be reserved. When `V=1` and 
`henvcfg.CFIE=0`, this encoding continues to be reserved at `VS` and `VU`.

The following faults may occur:

. If the accessed page is a shadow stack page
.. Stores other than `sspush` and `ssamoswap` cause write/AMO access faults.
.. Instructions fetch causes a page fault
. if the accessed page is not a shadow stack page
.. `ssamoswap` and `sspush` cause a store/AMO access fault
.. `sspop` causes a load access fault

To support these rules, the virtual address translation process specified in
section 4.3.2 of the Privileged Specification cite:[PRIV] is modified as
follows:
[start=3]
3. If `pte.v = 0` or if any bits of encodings that are reserved for future
   standard use are set within `pte`, stop and raise a page-fault exception
   corresponding to the original access type. The encoding `pte.xwr = 010b`
   is not reserved if `menvcfg.CFIE` is 1 or if `V=1` and `henvcfg.CFIE` is 1.
   
4. Otherwise, the PTE is valid. If `pte.r = 1` or `pte.w = 1` or `pte.x = 1`,
   go to step 5. Otherwise, this PTE is a pointer to the next level of the page
   table. Let `i = i - 1`. If `i < 0`, store and raise a page-fault exception
   corresponding to the original access type. Otherwise, let `a = pte.ppn x
   PAGESIZE` and go to step 2.

5. A leaf PTE has been found. If the memory access is by a shadow stack
   instruction and `pte.xwr != 010b` then cause an access-violation exception
   corresponding to the access type. If the memory access is a store/AMO and
   `pte.xwr == 010b` then cause a store/AMO access-violation. If the requested
   memory access is not allowed by the `pte.r`, `pte.w`, `pte.x`, and `pte.u`
   bits, given the current privilege mode and the value of the `SUM` and `MXR`
   fields of the `mstatus` register, stop and raise a page-fault exception
   corresponding to the original access type.

The `U` and `SUM` bit enforcement is performed normally for shadow stack
instruction initiated memory accesses. The state of the `MXR` bit does not
affect read access to a shadow stack page as the shadow stack page is always
readable by all instructions that load from memory.

Svpbmt extension and Svnapot extensions are supported for shadow stack pages. 

[NOTE]
====
Operating systems should protect against writeable non-shadow-stack alias
virtual-addresses mappings being created to the shadow stack physical memory. 
====

The G-stage address translation and protections are not affected by the shadow
stack extension. When G-stage page tables are active, the `ssamoswap`, and
`sspop` instructions require the G-stage page table mapping the accessed memory to
have read permission and the `ssamoswap` and `sspush` instructions require write
permission. The `xwr == 010b` encoding in the G-stage PTE remains reserved.

[NOTE]
====
A future extension may define shadow stack encoding the G-stage page table to
support use cases such as a hypervisor enforcing shadow stack protections for
virtual-supervisor.
====

[NOTE]
====
All instructions that load from memory are allowed to read the shadow stack. The
shadow stack only holds a copy of the link register as saved on the regular
stack. The ability to read the shadow stack is useful for debug, performance
profiling, and other use cases.
====

[[PMP_SS]]
==== PMP extension for shadow stack

When privilege mode is less than M, the PMP region accessed by `sspush` and
`ssamoswap` must provide write permission and the PMP region accessed by `sspop`
must provide read permission.

The M-mode memory accesses by `sspush` and `ssamoswap` instructions test for
write permission in the matching PMP entry when permission checking is required.

The M-mode memory accesses by `sspop` instruction tests for read permission in
the matching PMP entry when permission checking is required.

When the `Smepmp` extension is implemented, a new WARL field `sspmp` is defined
in bits 15:10 of the `mseccfg` CSR to configure a PMP entry as the shadow stack
memory region for M-mode accesses.

When `mseccfg.MML` is 1, the `sspmp` field is read-only else it may be written.

When `sspmp` field is implemented and `mseccfg.MML` is 1 the following rules are
additionally enforced for M-mode memory accesses:

* `sspush`, `sspop`, and `ssamoswap` instructions must match PMP entry `sspmp`.

* Write by instructions other than `sspush` and `ssamoswap` that match PMP entry
  `sspmp` cause an access violation exception.

[NOTE]
====
The PMP region used for the M-mode shadow stack is expected to be made
inaccessible for U- and S-mode read and write accesses. Allowing write access
violates the integrity of the shadow stack and allowing read access may lead to
disclosure of M-mode return addresses.
====
