== Backward-edge control-flow integrity

A shadow stack is a second stack used to push the link register if it needs to
be spilled to make a new procedure call. Leaf functions do not need to spill the
link register. A shadow stack is active for a privilege level `x` if `xBCFIEN`
is 1.  The shadow stack, similar to the regular stack, grows downwards, i.e.
from higher addresses to lower addresses. Each entry on the shadow stack is
`XLEN` wide and holds the link register value. The `ssp` points to the top of
the shadow stack, i.e. address of the last element pushed on the shadow stack.

[NOTE]
====
Compilers when generating code for a CFI enabled program must protect the link
register, e.g. `x1` and/or `x5`, from arbitrary modification by not emitting
unsafe code sequences.
====

== Backward-edge CFI instruction encoding

The backward-edge CFI extension introduces the following instructions for shadow
stack operations. All instructions are encoded using the SYSTEM major opcode and
using the `mop.r` and `mop.rr` instructions defined by the Zimops extension.

[width=100%]
[%header, cols="6,<6,>6,<3,>3,<3,>3,<3,>3,<3,>3", grid=rows, frame=none]

Encoding `rs1` as `x0` is not supported for `sspush`.
Encoding `rd`  as `x0` is not supported for `sspop`.

|===

Encoding `rd` as `x0` is not supported for `ssamoswap`.

If xBCFIEN is 0, the behavior of all backward-edge CFI instructions is as
defined by the Zimops extension and the instructions just write 0 to [rd].

[NOTE]
====
When programs using shadow stack instructions are installed on a machine that
supports the CFI extensions but the operating system installed does not enable
the CFI extensions, the program continues to function due to Zimops defined
behavior of writing 0 to [rd] and not causing an illegal-instruction exception.

When programs using shadow stack instructions are installed on a machine that
does not support the CFI extensions but support the Zimops extension, the
program continues to function due to Zimops defined behavior of writing 0 to
[rd] and not causing an illegal-instruction exception.
On machines that do not support Zimops extension, the instructions cause an
illegal-instruction exception. Installing programs that use the shadow stack
instructions on such machines is not supported.
====

=== Push to and Pop from the shadow stack

A push operation is defined as decrement of the `ssp` by `XLEN` followed by a
write of the link register at the new top of the shadow stack. A pop operation
is defined as a `XLEN` wide read from the current top of the shadow stack
followed by an increment of the `ssp`.

To push a link register on the shadow stack, the CFI extension provides
`sspush` instruction. To pop a link register from the shadow stack, the CFI
extension provides `sspop` instruction.

[NOTE]
====
Programs operating in shadow stack mode store the return address to the data
stack as well as the shadow stack in the function prologue. Such programs when
returning from the function load the link register from the data stack and load
a shadow copy of the link register from the shadow stack. The two values are
then compared (using the sschkra instruction that is discussed later). If the
values do not match it is indicative of a shadow stack violation and causes an
illegal-instruction exception. The function prologue and epilog of a function
using shadow stacks is as follows:

    function_entry:
        sspush x1      # push link register x1 on shadow stack
         :
         : 
        sspop x5       # pop from shadow stack into x5
        sschkra x5, x1 # compare link register x1 to shadow 
                       # link register x5; faults if not same
        ret

When x1 is used by the ABI as the link register, the x5 may be used to load the
shadow link register value from the shadow stack. Alternatively, if the ABI uses
x5 as the link register, then the x1 register may be used as the shadow link
register. 

A leaf function i.e. a function that does not itself make function calls does
not need to push the link register to the shadow stack or pop it from the shadow
stack. The return value may be held in the link register itself for the duration
of the function execution.

In the RVI psABI, the x1 register is designated as the link register and x5
register is designated as a temporary register. SInce the shadow link register
is loaded at the tail of the function, prior to return, the x5 register being
used as the shadow link register does not impose a burden on the compiler as the
x5 register, being a temporary register that is not preserved across a call, is
usually free for use at the tail of the function.

Programs operating in the control stack mode may store the return address only
to the shadow stack in the function prologue. Such functions when returning from
the function load the link register value from the shadow stack. Such programs
may either use the x1 or x5 register, depending on their ABI, as the link
register. The hardware return-address prediction stacks detect the use of x1/x5
as the rd and x1/x5 as the source for a JALR instruction to infer if the JALR is
used for a call or a return semantic for the purposes of prediction. To support
both options the CFI extension provides the x1 and x5 variants of the shadow
stack load and store.
====

`sspop` performs a load identically to the existing `LOAD` instruction with the
difference that the base is implicitly `ssp`, the width is implicitly `XLEN`.
`sspush` performs a store identically to the existing `STORE` instruction with
the difference that the base is implicitly `ssp`, the width is implicitly `XLEN`.

The `sspush` and `sspop` require the virtual address in `ssp` to have a shadow stack
attribute (see Shadow Stack Memory Protection). 

If the virtual address in `ssp` is not `XLEN` aligned then the instructions cause a
load or store/AMO address-misaligned exception.

[NOTE]
====
Misaligned accesses to shadow stack are not required and enforcing alignment is
more secure to detect errors in the program.
====

The operation of the `sspush` instructions is as follows:

.`sspush` operation
[source, text]
----
If xBCFIEN != 0
    [ssp] = [ssp] - (XLEN/8)   # decrement ssp by XLEN/8
   *[ssp] = [src]              # Store src value to address in ssp
else
    [dst] = 0
endif`
----

The operation of the `sspop` instructions is as follows:

.`sspop` operation
[source, text]
----
If xBCFIEN != 0
    dst   = *[ssp]             # Load dst from address in ssp
    [ssp] = [ssp] + (XLEN/8)   # increment ssp by XLEN/8
else
    [dst] = 0;
endif
----

[NOTE]
====
Store to load forwarding is a common technique employed by high performance
processor implementations. CFI implementations may restrict forwarding from a
non-shadow-stack store to a `sspop` instruction. A non-shadow-stack store causes a
fault if done to a page mapped as a shadow stack. However such determination may
be delayed till the PTE has been examined and thus may be used to transiently
forward the data from such stores to a `sspop`.
====

[NOTE]
====
A common operation performed on stacks is to unwind them to support constructs
like setjmp/longjmp, C++ exception handling, etc. A program that uses shadow
stacks must unwind the shadow stack in addition to the stack used to store data.
The unwind function must verify that it does not accidentally unwind past the
bounds of the shadow stack. Shadow stacks are expected to be bounded on each end
using guard pages i.e. pages that do not have a shadow stack attribute. To
detect if the unwind occurs past the bounds of the shadow stack the unwind may
be done in maximal increments of 4 KiB and testing for the ssp to be still
pointing to a shadow stack page or has unwound into the guard page. The
following examples illustrate use of backward-edge CFI instructions to unwind a
shadow stack.

[literal]
setjmp() {
    :
    :
    // read and save top of stack pointer to jmp_buf
    asm(“ssprr %0” : “=r”(cur_ssp):);
    jmp_buf->saved_ssp = cur_ssp;
    :
    :
}
longjmp() {
    :
    // Read current shadow stack pointer and 
    // compute number of call frames to unwind
    asm(“ssprr %0” : “=r”(cur_ssp):);
    // Skip the unwind if backward-edge CFI not active
    asm(“beqz %0, 1f” : “=r”(cur_ssp):);
    num_unwind = jmp_buf->saved_ssp - cur_ssp;
    // Unwind the frames in a loop
    while ( num_unwind > 0 ) {
        step = ( num_unwind >= 4096 ) ? 4096 : num_unwind;
        cur_ssp += step;
        num_unwind -= step;
        // write the ssp register with unwound value
        asm(“csrw %0, $ssp_csr_num” : “=r”(cur_ssp):);
        // Test if unwound past the shadow stack bounds
        asm(“sspush x5”);
        asm(“sspop  x5”);
    }
1f:
    :
}
====


=== Read `ssp` into a register

The `ssprr` instruction is provided to move the contents of `ssp` to the destination
register. 

The operation of the `ssprr` instructions is as follows:

.`ssprr` operation
[source, text]
----
If xBCFIEN != 0    
    [dst] = [ssp]
else
    [dst] = 0;
endif
----

[NOTE]
====
The property of Zimops writing 0 to the rd when the extension using Zimops is
not present or not active may be used by such functions to skip over unwind
actions by dynamically detecting if the backward-edge CFI extension is active.

An example sequence such as the following may be used:

[literal]
    ssprr t0                  # mv ssp to t0
    beqz bcfi_not_active      # zero is not a valid shadow stack
                              # pointer by convention
    # Shadow stacks active
    :
    :
bcfi_not_active:
====


=== Verifying return address

Programs operating with a shadow stack push the return address onto the data
stack as well as the shadow stack in the function prologue. Such programs when
returning from the function pop the link register from the data stack and pop a
shadow copy of the link register from the shadow stack. The two values are then
compared. If the values do not match it is indicative of a corruption of the
return address variable and the program causes an illegal instruction exception.

When x1 is used by the ABI as the link register, the x5 may be used to hold the
shadow link register value from the shadow stack. Alternatively, if the ABI uses
x5 as the link register, then the x1 register may be used as the shadow link
register. 

A `sschkra` instruction is provided to perform the comparison. The `sschkra`
instruction causes an illegal instruction exception if the both of following
conditions are satisfied:

*  x1 is not equal to x5
*  `xBCFIEN` is 1 i.e., backward-edge CFI is enabled for the program


=== Atomic Swap from a shadow stack location

The CFI extension defines an `ssamoswap` instruction to atomically swap the `XLEN`
bits of src register with `XLEN` bits on the shadow stack at address in `addr` and
store the value from address in `src` into register `dst`.

The `ssamoswap` is always sequentially consistent and cannot be reordered with
earlier or later memory operations from the same hart. 

The `ssamoswap` requires the virtual address in `ssp` to have a shadow stack
attribute (see Shadow Stack Memory Protection).

If the virtual address is not `XLEN` aligned then the instructions cause a
store/AMO address-misaligned exception.

The operation of the `ssamoswap` instructions is as follows:

.`ssamoswap` operation
[source, text]
----
If xBCFIEN != 0
    Perform the following atomically with sequential consistency
        [dst]  = *[addr]
       *[addr] = [src]
else
    [dst] = 0;
endif
----

[NOTE]
====
Stack switching is a common operation in user programs as well as supervisor
programs. When a stack switch is performed the stack pointer of the currently
active stack is saved into a context data structure and the new stack is made
active by loading a new stack pointer from a context data structure. 

When shadow stacks are enabled for a program, the program needs to additionally
switch the shadow stack pointer. The pointer to the top of the deactivated
shadow stack if held in a context data structure may be susceptible to memory
corruption vulnerabilities. To protect the pointer value the program may then
store it at the top of the shadow stack itself and thus create a checkpoint. 

An example sequence to store and restore the shadow stack pointer is as follows:

[literal]
# The a0 register holds the pointer to top of new shadow
# to switch to. The current ssp is first pushed on the current
# shadow stack and the ssp is restored from new shadow stack
save_shadow_stack_pointer:
    ssprr  x5                   # read ssp and push value onto
    sspush x5                   # shadow stack. The [ssp] now
                                # holds ssp+8. Save away x5
                                # into a context structure to
                                # restore later.
restore_shadow_stack_pointer:
    ssamoswap t0, a0, x0        # t0=*[ssp] and *[ssp]=0
    addi      t0, t0, (XLEN/8)  # t0+XLEN/8 must match to a0
    bnez      t0, a0, crash     # if not crash program
    csrw      ssp, t0           # setup new ssp

Further the program may enforce an invariant that a shadow stack can be active
only on one hart by using the ssamoswap when performing the restore from the
checkpoint such that the checkpointed data is zeroed as part of the restore
sequence and multiple hart attempt to restore the checkpointed data only one of
them succeeds.
====


=== Shadow Stack Memory Protection

To protect shadow stack memory the memory is associated with a new attribute -
Shadow Stack (SS) in the page tables and in the PMP configuration registers.
When a virtual-memory system is enabled, the SS attribute is obtained from the
page tables alone. When a virtual-memory system is disabled or not active, the
SS attribute is obtained from the PMP configuration registers. The rules
enforced by the SS attribute are specified in this section.

==== When Virtual-Memory system is enabled
The shadow stack memory is protected using page table attributes such that it
cannot be written by instructions other than sspush and amossswap. The shadow
stack can be read using all instructions that load from memory. 

The encoding R=0, W=1, and X=0, is defined as the shadow stack attribute when
UBCFIEN or SBCFIEN is 1. When UBCFIEN and SBCFIEN are 0, this encoding continues
to be reserved. The following faults occur:

. If the accessed page has SS attribute set
.. Stores other than `sspush`, and `ssamoswap` cause write/AMO page faults.
.. Instructions fetch causes an instruction page fault
. if the accessed page does not have an SS attribute.
.. `ssamoswap` causes store/AMO page fault
.. `sspush` cause store/AMO page fault
.. `sspop` cause load page fault

The `U` and `SUM` bit enforcement is performed normally. Svpbmt extension and
Svnapot extensions are supported for shadow stack mappings. 

When a virtual-memory system is enabled, the SS attribute from a matching PMP
entry is ignored.

[NOTE]
====
Operating systems should protect against writeable non-shadow-stack alias
virtual-addresses mappings being created to the shadow stack physical memory. 
====

The G-stage address translation and protections are not affected by the shadow
stack extension. When G-stage page tables are active, the `ssamoswap`, and
`sspop` instructions require the G-stage page table mapping the accessed memory to
have read permission and the `ssamoswap` and `sspush` instructions require write
permission. The SS encoding in the G-stage PTE remains reserved.

[NOTE]
====
A future extension may define shadow stack encoding the G-stage page table to
support use cases such as a hypervisor enforcing shadow stack protections for
virtual-supervisor.
====

[NOTE]
====
All loads are allowed to read the shadow stack. The shadow stack only holds a
copy of the link register as saved on the regular stack. The ability to read the
shadow stack is useful for debug, performance profiling, and other use cases.
====

==== When Virtual-Memory system is not enabled

When operating in M-mode, the virtual-memory system is not enabled. When
operating in S-mode or U-mode (including when V=1), if the `satp` has `MODE`
field set to `Bare`, then the virtual-memory system is not enabled. 

A `pmpsscfg` CSR is a M-mode MXLEN wide register that is used to associate a PMP
entry with shadow stack attributes. The fields of `pmpsscfg` register are WARL
and bit `i` corresponds to the PMP entry `i`. When the backward-edge CFI
extension is not supported the register is read-only zero. When bit `i` is set
in `pmpsscfg`, the R/W/X permission bits in the corresponding `pmp<i>cfg` must
be set to `010b`. 

A memory access by `sspush`, `sspop`, and `ssamoswap` instructions to PMP `i`
succeeds only if bit `i` of `pmpsscfg` is 1 and the R=0, W=1, and X=0 in the
corresponding `pmp<i>cfg`.

A store to memory by instructions other than `sspush` and `ssamoswap` does not
succeed if bit `i` of `pmpsscfg` is 1 and the R=0, W=1, and X=0 in the
corresponding `pmp<i>cfg`. 

Execute access that matches PMP entry `i` does not succeed if bit `i` of
`pmpsscfg` is 1 and the R=0, W=1, and X=0 in the corresponding `pmp<i>cfg`.
