== Introduction

Control-flow Integrity (CFI) provides CPU instruction set architecture (ISA)
capabilities to defend against Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) and
Call/Jump-Oriented Programming (COP/JOP) style control-flow subversion attacks.
This attack methodology uses code sequences in authorized modules with at least
one instruction in the sequence being a control transfer instruction that
depends on attacker-controlled data either in the return stack or in a
register/memory for the target address. Attackers stitch these sequences
together by diverting the control flow instruction (e.g., RET, CALL, JMP) from
its original target address to a new target via modification in the data stack
or in the register or memory used by these instructions.

This specification describes CFI security objectives, threat model, and various
architectural design choices to ensure that the design meets the security
objectives.

RV32/RV64 provide two types of control transfer instructions - unconditional
jumps and conditional branches. Conditional branches encode an offset in the
immediate field of the instruction and are thus direct branches that are not
susceptible to control flow subversion.

Unconditional direct jumps using `JAL` transfer control to a target that is in a
+/- 1 MiB range from the current `pc`. Unconditional indirect jumps using the
`JALR` obtain their branch target by adding the sign extended 12-bit immediate
encoded in the instruction to the `rs1` register.

The RV32I/RV64I does not have a dedicated instruction for calling a procedure or
returning from a procedure. A `JAL` or `JALR` may be used to perform either a
procedure call or a return from a procedure. The RISC-V ABI however defines the
convention that a `JAL`/`JALR` where `rd` (i.e. the link register) is `x1` or
`x5` is a procedure call, and a `JAL`/`JALR` where `rs1` is the conventional
link register (i.e.  `x1` or `x5`) is a return from procedure. The architecture
allows for using these hints and conventions to support return address
prediction and the hints are specified in Table 2.1 of the Unprivileged ISA
specifications cite:[UNPRIV].

The RVC standard extension for compressed instructions provides unconditional
jump and conditional branch instructions. The `C.J` and `C.JAL` instructions
encode an offset in the immediate field of the instruction and thus are not
susceptible to control flow subversion.

The `C.JR` and `C.JALR` RVC instruction performs a unconditional control
transfer to the address in register `rs1`. The `C.JALR` additionally writes the
address of the instruction following the jump (`pc+2`) to the link register `x1`
and is a procedure call. The `C.JR` where `rs1` is the conventional link
register (i.e. `x1` or `x5`) is a return from procedure. A `C.JR` where `rs1` is
not the conventional link register is a indirect jump.

The RISC-V control-flow integrity (CFI) extension (Zisslpcfi) builds on these
conventions and hints. 

The term call is used to refer to a `JAL` or `JALR` instruction with a link
register as destination i.e., `rd != x0`. Conventionally the link register is
`x1` or `x5`. A call using `JAL` or `C.JAL` is termed a direct call. A `C.JALR`
expands to `JALR x1, 0(rs1)` and is a call. A call using `JALR` or `C.JALR` is
termed an indirect call.

The term return is used to refer to a `JALR` instruction with `rs1 == x1` or
`rs1 == x5` and `rd == x0`. A `C.JR` instruction expands to `JALR x0, 0(rs1)`
and is a return if `rs1 == x1` or `rs1 == x5`.

The term indirect jump is used to refer to a `JALR` instruction with `rd == x0`
and where the `rs1` is not `x1` or `x5` (i.e. not a return). The `C.JR`
instruction where `rs1` is not `x1` or `x5` (i.e. not a return) is an indirect
jump.

To enforce backward edge control flow integrity, the extension introduces a
shadow stack. The shadow-stack is designed to provide integrity to control
transfers performed using return instruction (where the return may be from a
procedure invoked using an indirect call or a direct call) and this is referred
to as backward-edge protection. A program using backward control flow integrity
has two stack - a regular stack and a shadow stack - and the shadow stack is
used exclusively to store the shadow copies of return adddresses.

The shadow stack is used to spill the link register if required by
non-leaf functions. A shadow-stack-pointer (`ssp`) register is introduced in the
architecture to hold the address of the top of the current active shadow stack.
The shadow stack is protected from inadvertent corruptions and modifications as
detailed later. The extension provides instructions to store and load the link
register to the shadow stack. A function in a program compiled to use shadow
stacks stores the link register to the data stack and a shadow copy of the link
register to the shadow stack when the function is entered (the prologue). When
the function needs to return (the epilogue), the function loads the link
register from the data stack and the shadow copy of the link register from the
shadow stack. The link register value from the data stack and the shadow link
register value from the shadow stack are compared. A mismatch of the two values
is indicative of a subversion of the return address control variable and causes
an illegal-instruction trap.

[NOTE]
====
Operating in shadow stack mode, i.e., where the call stack layout is preserved
and the shadow stack is used to store a shadow copy of the link register,
preserves the ABI.

A program may alternatively operate in control stack mode where the link
register is stored only on the shadow stack. Such programs break the ABI but
benefit from avoiding the additional instructions to store and load the link
register to the data stack and to compare the two before returning from a
function. Control stack mode may also allow the program to have a smaller data
stack as the space to save the link register is no longer needed.
====

To enforce forward edge control flow integrity, the extension introduces new
landing pad instructions (`lpcll`) that enable software to indicate valid targets
for indirect calls and jumps in a program. Compiler is expected to emit a `lpcll`
as the first instruction of address-taken functions. Compiler is expected to
emit a `lpcll` at an indirect jump target.

The Zisslpcfi extension identifies an indirect call or an indirect jump as
follows:

[[IND_CALL_JMP]]
.Indirect call/jump determination
[source, text]
----
    if ( ((JALR && rd == x0) || (C.JR)) && (rs1 != x1) && (rs1 != x5) )
        is_indirect_jump = 1;
    else
        is_indirect_jump = 0;

    if ( (JALR && rd != x0) || (C.JALR) )
        is_indirect_call = 1;
    else
        is_indirect_call = 0;

    is_indirect_call_jump = is_indirect_call | is_indirect_jump;
----

The landing-pads are designed to provide integrity to control transfers
performed using indirect call and indirect jump and this is referred to as
forward-edge protection.

When the landing pad feature is active, the hart tracks an expected landing pad
(`ELP`) state that is updated with the expected landing pad instruction on
indirect calls and jumps to . An indirect call or jump updates the `ELP` to
require a `lpcll` instruction at the target. If the instruction at the target is
not `lpcll` then an illegal instruction exception is raised. 

The landing pads may be labeled. With labeling enabled, the number of landing
pads that can be reached from an indirect call or indirect jump site can be
constrained using programming language based policies. A landing pad label
(`lpl`) is set up prior to initiating an indirect call or indirect jump with the
 expected landing pad label using an instruction to set the `lpl`. If the label
of the landing pad does not match that in `lpl` then an illegal instruction
exception is raised.

Up to 25-bit labels are supported by this extension. 

[NOTE]
====
In the simplest form the program may be built with a single label value to
implement a coarse-grain version of forward-edge CFI. Such a program would
significantly reduce the gadget space by constraining gadgets to be preceded by
a landing pad instruction i.e., to the start of indirect callable functions. 

A second form of label generation may generate a signature (e.g., a MAC) using
the prototype of the functions. Such programs would further constrain the
gadgets reachable from a call site to indirect callable functions that have the
expected prototype of functions called by that call site.

A third form of label generation may generate labels by analyzing the
control-flow-graph (CFG) of the program and lead to even further constraining of
the gadgets reachable. Such programs may further use the multi-label capability
such that when a function is called from two or more call sites, then such
common functions may be labeled as reachable from each of the call sites. For
example, consider two call sites A and B. A invokes functions X and Y. B invokes
functions Y and Z. With a single label scheme the functions X, Y, and Z would
need to be assigned the same label such that both call site A and B can invoke
the common function Y. This allows call site A to additionally call function Z
and call site B to additionally call function X. However, if function Y was
labeled with two labels - one corresponding to call site A and other to call
site B then Y can be invoked by both but the X can only be invoked by call site
A and Z only by call site B. To support multiple labels, the compiler may create
a call site specific entrypoint to such shared functions with each entrypoint
containing the call site specific landing pad instruction followed by a direct
branch to the start of the function.

A portion of the label space may be dedicated to label landing pads that are
only valid targets of an indirect jump (and not an indirect call).

====

Forward-edge and backward-edge CFI may be enabled for a program that executes in
U-mode, S-mode, or M-mode by itself to enable a mix of CFI enabled applications,
operating systems, and machine mode firmware to co-exist. The processor keeps
track of the CFI enables and CFI state for each mode in the `mstatus` CSR. A
subset of the fields in the `mstatus` CSR are accessible using the `sstatus`
CSR. VS-mode’s version of `sstatus` (`vsstatus`) tracks the CFI state for
VS-mode and VU-mode.

[NOTE]
====
To use Zisslpcfi, the operating system has to be modified to enable Zisslpcfi
capabilities, including the context switching of additional CFI extension state.
The set of programs installed in such an OS may however be a mix where some
programs are compiled with Zisslpcfi capabilities and others are not. Allowing the
U-mode CFI be individually enabled from S-mode allows an operating system to keep
CFI enabled when operating in S-mode but enable or disable it for U-mode depending
on the program being executed in U-mode.
====

To support backward compatibility of the programs built with Zisslpcfi support, the
new instructions to operate on the shadow stack, the landing pad instructions,
and the instructions to set the `lpl` are encoded using Zimop encodings. When
Zisslpcfi is not enabled for a program or the program is executing on a processor
that does not support the Zisslpcfi extension then the instructions introduced by
the Zisslpcfi extensions execute as defined by Zimop extension.

[NOTE]
====
An OS distribution compiled with Zisslpcfi extension typically also includes the
system libraries (e.g., glibc, etc.) that are also compiled with the Zisslpcfi
extension. Such system libraries however may need to link dynamically to
programs that are not compiled with the Zisslpcfi extension. When such programs are
executing, the OS may disable the Zisslpcfi extension in U-mode. When these system
libraries are invoked in U-mode by such programs, the Zisslpcfi instructions in the
libraries revert to their Zimop defined behavior. Without such encoding, the OS
distribution may need to carry two versions of such libraries, one with Zisslpcfi
instructions and one without, and thus need significantly larger cost and
complexity for supporting the Zisslpcfi extension.

An OS distribution compiled with Zisslpcfi extension may be installed on a machine
that does not support Zisslpcfi extensions. On such machines, as the Zisslpcfi
instructions are encoded as Zimop, they revert to their Zimop defined behavior.

A program compiled with the Zisslpcfi extension may be installed on an OS that is
not compiled for the Zisslpcfi extension or on a machine that does not support the
Zisslpcfi extension. The Zisslpcfi instructions are encoded as Zimop revert back
to their Zimop defined behavior.
====

The Zisslpcfi extension depends on the Zicsr extension, the A extension, and the
Zimop extension.
