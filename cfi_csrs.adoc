[[CSRs]]
== Shadow Stack and Landing Pad CSRs

This chapter specifies the CSR state of the Zisslpcfi extension.

=== Machine environment configuration registers (`menvcfg and menvcfgh`)

The `CFIE` (bit 60) field controls if Zisslpcfi extension is available for use
in modes less privileged than M. When `CFIE` is 1, the `SFCFIE` (bit 59) field
enables forward-edge CFI at S-mode.

When `menvcfg.CFIE` bit is 0, then at privilege modes less privileged than M:

* Attempts to access `ssp` CSR and `lplr` CSR raise an illegal instruction
  exception.
* Zisslpcfi extension instructions revert to the Zimop defined behavior.
* The `UBCFIE`, `UFCFIE` and `SPELP` fields in `mstatus` are read-only zero.
* The `CFIE` field in `henvcfg` is read-only zero.
* The `pte.xwr=010b` encoding in S-stage page tables is reserved.

[NOTE]
====
When the Zisslpcfi extension is available for use at privilege level less than
M, the operating system may use the `UBCFIE` and `UFCFIE` to selectively
enable the backward-edge and forward-edge CFI at U mode per application.

When the Zisslpcfi extension is available for use at S-mode, the operating
system may use shadow stacks at S-mode. If the operating system uses
forward-edge CFI then it may request the SEE to set `SFCFIE` to 1.

With these set of controls the backward-edge and forward-edge CFI may be
separately enforced at S-mode and for each application.

=== Hypervisor environment configuration registers (`menvcfg and henvcfg`)

The `CFIE` (bit 60) bit controls if Zisslpcfi extension is available for use in
VS and VU modes. When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 0, `henvcfg.CFIE` is read-only zero.

When `henvcfg.CFIE` bit is 0, then at privilege modes VS and VU:

* Attempts to access `ssp` CSR and `lplr` CSR raise an illegal instruction
  exception.
* The `UBCFIE`, `UFCFIE` and `SPELP` fields in `vsstatus` are read-only zero.
* The `pte.xwr=010b` encoding in VS-stage page tables remains reserved.

When `CFIE` is 1, the `SFCFIE` (bit 59) field enables forward-edge CFI at VS-mode.

=== Machine status registers (`mstatus`)

The `UFCFIE` (bit 23) and `UBCFIE` (bit 24) are WARL fields that when set to 1
enable backward-edge and forward-edge CFI respectively at U-mode.

The `SPELP` (bit 25) and `MPELP` (bit 26) WARL fields are updated when a trap is
taken into M-mode or S-mode respectively. When a trap is taken into privilege
mode `x`, the `xPELP` fields are updated to indicate that a landing pad was
expected at the privilege level `xPP` at the time of taking the trap. 

The `xPELP` fields are encoded as follows:

* 0 - `NO_LP_EXPECTED` - no landing pad instruction expected
* 1 - `LP_EXPECTED` - landing pad instruction expected

=== Supervisor status registers (`sstatus`)

When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 1, access to the following fields accesses the homonymous
field of `mstatus` register. When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 0, these fields are read-only
zero.

* `UFCFIE` (bit 23)
* `UBCFIE` (bit 24)
* `SPELP` (bit 25)

=== Virtual supervisor status registers (`vsstatus`)

The `vsstatus` register is VS-mode's version of `sstatus` and the Zisslpcfi
extension introduces the following fields.

* `UFCFIE` (bit 23)
* `UBCFIE` (bit 24)
* `SPELP` (bit 25)

When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 0, these fields are read-only zero. When `menvcfg.CFIE` is
1 and `henvcfg.CFIE` is 0, these fields are read-only zero in `sstatus` (really
`vsstatus`) when V=1.

[NOTE]
====
The `vsstatus` and `henvcfg` CSR for a virtual machine may be restored in any
order. The state of `henvcfg.CFIE` does not prevent access to the bits introduced
in `vsstatus` when the CSR is accessed in HS-mode.
====

=== Landing pad label register (`lplr`)

The `lplr` CSR is a unprivileged read-write (URW) 32-bit register that holds the
label expected at the target of an indirect call or an indirect jump. The label
is split into a 8-bit upper label (`UL`), 8-bit middle label (`ML`), and a
9-bit lower label (`LL`).

.`lplr` for RV32 and RV64
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 9, name: 'LL'},
  {bits: 8, name: 'ML'},
  {bits: 8, name: 'UL'},
  {bits: 7, name: 'WPRI'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024}}
....

When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 0, an attempt to access `lplr` in a mode other than M-mode
raises an illegal instruction exception. When `sstatus.UFCFIE` is 0, an attempt
to access `lplr` in U-mode raises an illegal instruction exception. 

[NOTE]
====
Access to `lplr` at S-mode is not dependent on `sstatus.UFCFIE` or
`menvcfg.SFCFIE` to allow an operating system to be able to context switch
U-mode `lplr` state even when the operating system itself does not enable the
use of forward-edge CFI at S-mode.
====

When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 1 but `henvcfg.CFIE` is 0, an attempt to access `lplr` when
`V=1` raises a virtual instruction exception. 

When `menvcfg.CFIE` and `henvcfg.CFIE` are both 1 but `vsstatus.UFCFIE` is 0, an
attempt to access `lplr` in VU-mode raises an illegal instruction exception.

=== Shadow stack pointer (`ssp`) 

The `ssp` CSR is an unprivileged read-write (URW) CSR that reads and writes `XLEN`
low order bits of the shadow stack pointer (`ssp`). There is no high CSR defined
as the `ssp` is always as wide as the `XLEN` of the current privilege level.

When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 0, an attempt to access `ssp` in a mode other than M-mode
raises an illegal instruction exception. When `sstatus.UBCFIE` is 0, an attempt
to access `ssp` in U-mode raises an illegal instruction exception.

[NOTE]
====
Access to `ssp` at S-mode is not dependent on `sstatus.UBCFIE` to allow an
operating system to be able to context switch U-mode `ssp` per application.
====

When `menvcfg.CFIE` is 1 but `henvcfg.CFIE` is 0, an attempt to access `ssp` when
`V=1` raises a virtual instruction exception. 

When `menvcfg.CFIE` and `henvcfg.CFIE` are both 1 but `vsstatus.UBCFIE` is 0, an
attempt to access `ssp` in VU-mode raises an illegal instruction exception.

=== Machine Security Configuration (`mseccfg`)

When the `Smepmp` extension is implemented, a new WARL field `sspmp` is defined
in bits 15:10 of the `mseccfg` CSR to configure a PMP entry as the shadow stack
memory region for M-mode accesses. The rules enforced by PMP for M-mode shadow
stack memory accesses are outlined in <<PMP_SS>>.

The `MFCFIE` (bit 9) is a WARL fields that when set to 1 enables forward-edge
CFI at M-mode.
